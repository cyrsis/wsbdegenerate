## Inspiration

In the GameStop Saga, Retail investor such as myself are not 
financial educated to handle

YoLo -> Put every penny into a single Stock

I have done it but ran out of ideas to tell my wife.
and totally broke

The transaction is T+2 , bank account show single digit 

What if I can have the shares as NFTs and under my name?

If I NFTs my share, and I also NFTs my id card, can I get a loan for some quick cash?

What if we can make NFT directly  on my phone?

Coupons, Membership cards, Credit cards, tax payment, bills everything is NFTs. 

Would that ever work?

and how much paper we can save?

let's find out 

Power to the Player!!!

Solana just happen to have the bandwidth to make the NFT sustainable


##What it does

Reddit Style -E-commerical Store, 

- Mobile First
- One click  for buying lot of NFTs finally,
- Pay Bills
- P to P transfer  
- Buy NFTs pork chop first and get the grocery deliver to my house(awesome)   


##How we built it

Flutter for both IOS and Android, Multi-chain with Solana, 

- local chain for now ,Rest of them need to figure it out.
- candle machine as service


##Challenges we ran into

- No direct binding with any wallets, the best way is to use API as Service

##Accomplishments that we're proud of

For once we have a way to claim the rightful of our ownership on everything

##What we learned
Why mobile first for this project

Solana is fast enough to have good experience with mobile

##What's next for Degenerate

Keep adding features , day by day,and  have some fun

##Built With

flutter, hasura, solana , firebase for auth, firebase

----
To-do
-- need to setup the enviroment
-- Build a hello world  with Rust and intellij

## Note
Solana is not EVM compatible but it offers a 
bidirectional token bridge between Solana and 
Ethereum so projects can move tokenized assets across blockchains.

Role of the SOL token : The token is used to pay for the transaction fees 
in the network and to reward participant in the Proof of Stake consensus
