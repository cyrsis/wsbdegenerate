## Inspiration

Started with a guy in youtube saying beloved GameStop is going out of businss.

and the youtube said Solana is unstoppable

I do my part as Support by buying then YOLO life saving at GameStop

different stage while packing with crowdsourced idea and confirmation(DD).

Cover the strong basic BUY AND STRONG HOLD

The diamond hand strategy and diamond ball strategy

During the evolve of our education with different point of views of unknow people in the website with lot of wrinkle brains

We have develop

- a mind for fear, doubt and uncertainity (FUD) for short
- SEC, Market Maker and Broker steal, cheat and 
- deal with shit chat bot spread FUD
- figure out the unstoppable
- cannt read
- too long didnt read TL;DR

##What it does

Reddit Style -Social Ideas for invest as retails, uniform information for how hedgies, the market maker take advantage of us.

One click Yolo(Clean the floor ) for the NFTs,

Direct named NFT

##How we built it

Flutter for both IOS and Android, Multi-chain with Solana, Main net Rest of them need to figure it out.

##Challenges we ran into

Learning Rust, and dont have docker Setting the enviroment is kind of tedious

##Accomplishments that we're proud of

For once we finally own something

##What we learned

Rust is pretty good language and solana is fast

##What's next for Degenerate

Keep adding features , day by day, have some fun

##Built With

flutter, hasura, solana

----
To-do
-- need to setup the enviroment
-- Build a hello world  with Rust and intellij

## Note
Solana is not EVM compatible but it offers a 
bidirectional token bridge between Solana and 
Ethereum so projects can move tokenized assets across blockchains.

Role of the SOL token : The token is used to pay for the transaction fees 
in the network and to reward participant in the Proof of Stake consensus
